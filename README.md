# Model REVOLVER

Model REVOLVER (Rapid Evolution Via Optimized-List Viewer Evaluated Response) is a Python script designed to merge and evaluate two machine learning models using Hugging Face's Transformers. The tool makes `x` cycles of model mergers, reads prompts from a text file, generates responses, and saves relevant data to individual text files. When the cycles are complete, the system notifies the user to review the outputs, allowing them to choose the cycle number that best fits the model they want to assemble.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- CUDA compatible GPU (Optional but recommended)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/model-revolver.git
   cd model-revolver
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**

   ```bash
   pip install transformers colorama numpy datasets flask requests
   ```

3. **Download the models you want to merge and place them in appropriate directories.**

4. **Create a text file named `prompts.txt` containing the prompts for evaluation.**

## Utility

Model REVOLVER merges two pre-trained models, evaluating them through cycles to generate responses based on input prompts. It enables users to iteratively merge models and select the best combination based on their preferences.

## Practical Use Case

Model REVOLVER can be used by researchers, data scientists, and developers who want to experiment with different model combinations. By merging various models, users can potentially create more robust and specialized models tailored to specific tasks or domains.

## Usage

### Command Line Arguments

- `--firstmodel`: Path to the first model.
- `--secondmodel`: Path to the second model.
- `--mergedpath`: Path to save the merged model.
- `--num_cycles`: Number of merge-eval-delete cycles to perform (default 3).
- `--fp16`: Save the merged model in half precision (fp16) (default False).
- `--shardsize`: Max shard size for the merged model (default "18000MiB").

### Example Command

```bash
python model_revolver.py --firstmodel /path/to/first/model --secondmodel /path/to/second/model --mergedpath /path/to/save/merged/model
```

### Workflow

1. **Merge Models:** Combines layers of two models based on randomly generated merge ratios.
2. **Generate Responses:** Uses the merged model to generate responses to prompts from `prompts.txt`.
3. **Review Outputs:** After all cycles, users review the outputs and select the best cycle.
4. **Recreate Model:** The selected model is recreated and saved based on the user's choice.
